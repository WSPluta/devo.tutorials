Verrazzano packs a nice set of capabilities that helps you with the operational side of of Kubernetes. From monitoring to logging and security, a Kubernetes or application administrator can get more done, faster once you know how to use it.

So let's try Verrazzano on Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)!  Here's what we'll cover:

1.	[Setting up: A brief introduction to Verrazzano, Oracle's end-to-end container platform for "multi-cloud and hybrid environments"](1-deploying-verrazzano-on-oke)
2.	[Part One: We'll create a cluster using the Terraform OKE module](2-deploy-multi-cluster-verrazzano-oke)
3.	[Part Two: Next, we'll configure the clusters so they behave as a kind of global cluster](3-deploy-multi-cluster-verrazzano-oke)
