APIs are not just for receiving information about an end-point.

APIs can do other tasks too, like use Python.

Because we'll be using Python, let's start with the [Github OCI Python SDK page](https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk/tree/master/examples). There are a number of Python example scripts here.

{% imgx assets/api-management-gh-python.png "Github page of the Python SDK" %}

Through trial and error, some of the examples there have been found to work with the Oracle Free Tier.

For example, itâ€™s easy enough to display some basic information about IP addresses and DNS using the `get_all_instance_ip_addresses_and_dns_info.py` script.

```console
$ cd ~/oci-python-sdk/examples$ python3 get_all_instance_ip_addresses_and_dns_info.py <OCID of instance>
```

{% imgx assets/api-management-ip-and-dns.png "Terminal displaying IP and DNS info with some information obscured" %}

This is great and all, but with APIs you can also do some real work!

## Create a user in the Oracle Free Tier

All the Python scripts for the Python SDK are here:

```console
$ cd ~/oci-python-sdk/examples
```

For example, check out the `raw_request.py` script:

```python
import requests
from oci.config import from_file
from oci.signer import Signerconfig = from_file()
auth = Signer(
tenancy=config['tenancy'],
user=config['user'],
fingerprint=config['fingerprint'],
private_key_file_location=config['key_file'],
pass_phrase=config['pass_phrase']
)endpoint = 'https://identity.ap-sydney-1.oraclecloud.com/20160918/users/'body = {
'compartmentId': config['tenancy'],  # root compartment
'name': 'TestUser',
'description': 'Created with a raw request'
}response = requests.post(endpoint, json=body, auth=auth)
response.raise_for_status()print(response.json()['id'])
```

Run the script as follows:

```console
$ python3 raw_request.py
```

That command will create a user named `TestUser` and return the OCID.

This user can be verified to exist in the console.

### Create a group and a user in the Oracle Free Tier

You can also run  `script user_crud.py` to create a user and group in Oracle Cloud.

```python
import oci
from oci.identity.models import AddUserToGroupDetails, CreateGroupDetails, CreateUserDetails# Default config file and profile
config = oci.config.from_file()
compartment_id = config["tenancy"]
# Service client
identity = oci.identity.IdentityClient(config)# Get and set the home region for the compartment. User crud operations need
# to be performed in the home region.
response = identity.list_region_subscriptions(compartment_id)
for region in response.data:
    if region.is_home_region:
        identity.base_client.set_region(region.region_name)
        breakuser_name = "python-sdk-example-user"
group_name = "python-sdk-example-group"print("Creating a new user {!r} in compartment {!r}".format(
    user_name, compartment_id))request = CreateUserDetails()
request.compartment_id = compartment_id
request.name = user_name
request.description = "Created by a Python SDK example"
user = identity.create_user(request)
print(user.data)print("Creating a new group {!r} in compartment {!r}".format(
    group_name, compartment_id))request = CreateGroupDetails()
request.compartment_id = compartment_id
request.name = group_name
request.description = "Created by a Python SDK example"
group = identity.create_group(request)
print(group.data)print("Adding new user to the new group")
request = AddUserToGroupDetails()
request.user_id = user.data.id
request.group_id = group.data.id
membership = identity.add_user_to_group(request)
print(membership.data)
```

Run that script with:

```console
$ python3 user_crud.py
```

As a result, a group is created named `python-sdk-example-group`:

{% imgx assets/api-management-python-create-group.png "OCI dashboard displaying group information" %}

A user will also be created in the group called `python-sdk-example-user`:

{% imgx assets/api-management-user-information.png "OCI panel displaying user information" %}

User management in Oracle Free Tier could hardly be easier!
