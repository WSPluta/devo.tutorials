Verrazzano packs a nice set of capabilities that helps you with the operational side of Kubernetes. From monitoring to logging and security, a Kubernetes or application administrator can get more done, faster.

So let's try Verrazzano on Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)!  Here's what we'll cover in the series:

1. [Setting up: We'll begin with a brief introduction to Verrazzano, Oracle's end-to-end container platform for "multi-cloud and hybrid environments"](1-deploying-verrazzano-on-oke)
2. [Part One: We'll create a cluster using the Terraform OKE module](2-deploy-multi-cluster-verrazzano-oke)
3. [Part Two: We'll conclude by configuring the clusters so they behave like a large, global cluster](3-deploy-multi-cluster-verrazzano-oke)
